# Covid_SIR_Model
SIR Model for South Carolina, USA

  
Hi Guys!

I am Kartikey Sharma and I am a student of IIT Goa<br>
I developed this project as my assignment for BIO101 course which was based on the SIR Model to fit the COVID data for South Carolina

I used the dataset from the below link
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us
(till 21st June 2020)

I then refined the dataset using Microsoft Excel and the final dataset is as in the folder
<br>
I have indented and commented the code which would make it easy for you guys to understand it
<br>However, if you have any doubts and know me, you can contact me for clarification :)
<br>
Kindly raise any issues if you find any error or want to improve and I would be 
<br>more than happy to help :p


Adi√≥s! <br>
